# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

'''There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1'''



# Time complexity: O(log n) due to the binary search approach.
# Space complexity: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space for variables.
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        l = 0
        h = n-1

        while l <= h:
            mid = (l+h)//2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            if nums[mid] <= nums[h]:   # or we can check nums[low]<= nums[mid] both will work
                if target >= nums[mid] and target <= nums[h]:
                    l = mid+1
                else:
                    h = mid-1
            else:
                if target >= nums[l] and target <= nums[mid]:
                    h = mid-1
                else:
                    l = mid+1
        return -1
