111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    # Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node once.
    # Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree, which is the minimum depth. In the worst case (skewed tree), h can be equal to n
