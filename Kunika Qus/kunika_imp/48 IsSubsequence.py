# 392. Is Subsequence

'''
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.

    # T -> O(n) where n is the length of t
    # S -> O(1) if we ignore the recursive stack space, otherwise O(n) in worst case when s and t are the same

        if len(t) == 0:
            return False

        if s[0] == t[0]:
            return self.isSubsequence(s[1:], t[1:])
        else:
            return self.isSubsequence(s, t[1:])
